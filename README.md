## Getting Started
This repository aims to assist a user in beginning work on a MERN stack application for heroku deployment with a solid file structure as a foundation. 

- A ReactJS front end that uses jwt_passport for authentication and authorization .
- A MongoDB Backend connection.
- App  deployed directly to heroku since there a script defined in package.json which will automatically handle building and deploying the app

Since this project will hold both the client application and the server application there will be node modules in two different places. First run `npm install` from the root. After this you will run `npm  install` from the root. Then create a `.env` file with your secret key, and MongoDB connection string. This is a script we have defined in package.json. Alternatively your group may choose to simplify this process by using yarn workspaces as specified [here](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/).
Heroku only accept either or `yarn` `npm`

This app has been deployed directly to heroku since there is a script defined in package.json which will automatically handle building and deploying the app. For more information on deploying to heroku reference the extra resources at the bottom of this file.

## Available Scripts

Please note that any time the server is run in these scripts `nodemon` is used in place of `node` for easier development. If you are interested in how this works follow the nodemon In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs both the client app and the server app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the client in the browser.


### `yarn workspace server build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

If deploying to heroku this does not need to be run since it is handled by the heroku-postbuild script<br>

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.


## File structure
#### `client` - Holds the client application
- #### `public` - This holds all of our static files
- #### `src`
    - #### `assets` - This folder holds assets such as images, docs, and fonts
    - #### `components` - This folder holds all of the different components that will make up our views
    - #### `store` - Initial User check. Verifying token saved
    - #### `actions` - Decode token to get user data, Set current user
    - #### `App.js` - This is what renders all of our browser routes and different views
    - #### `index.js` - This is what renders the react app by rendering App.js, should not change
- #### `package.json` - Defines npm behaviors and packages for the client
#### `server` - Holds the server application
- #### `config` - This holds our configuration files, like mongoDB uri
- #### `controllers` - These hold all of the callback functions that each route will call
- #### `models` - This holds all of our data models
- #### `routes` - This holds all of our HTTP to URL path associations for each unique url
- #### `tests` - This holds all of our server tests that we have defined
- #### `server.js` - Defines npm behaviors and packages for the client
#### `package.json` - Defines npm behaviors like the scripts defined in the next section of the README
#### `.gitignore` - Tells git which files to ignore
#### `README` - This file!
